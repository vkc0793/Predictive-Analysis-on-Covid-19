# Predictive-Analysis-on-Covid-19

In this project, Predicting the covid 19 patients using Machine Learning and using Python tools such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn to explore the data and visualize the univariant and bivariant features.
Here, the dataset contains null values and wrong data. So I carried out Data Cleaning and then after encoding, undersampled the dataset to achieve 50-50 target and finally splitting the undersampled dataset into train dataset and test dataset and again divided the train dataset into train data(80%) and valid data (20%).
Mysql database is used to query the data.
